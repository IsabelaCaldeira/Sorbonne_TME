 # TME classes at Sorbonne :woman_technologist: :blue_heart: 

But what is TME? TME stands for Travail sur machine encadr√©s or in english: work in frame machines. 

In the first semestre, we used MrPython as the IDE and Python as the language, and we try to solve problems and exercices with the helps of those tools.

You might notice through the code some especific ways of coding and comments and the reason for that is MrPython rules. 

***The typying of variables in Python can also be done with others IDEs if you import the library Typings

In the second semestre, we are working with C and here will be some part of that process, hope you enjoy it <3
