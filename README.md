 # TME classes at Sorbonne :woman_technologist: :blue_heart: 

But what is TME? TME stands for Travail sur machine encadrés or in english: work in frame machines. 

In those classes we use MrPython as the IDE and Python as the language.

You might notice through the code some especific ways of coding and comments and the reason for that is MrPython rules.
