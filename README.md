 # TME classes at Sorbonne :woman_technologist: :blue_heart: 

But what is TME? TME stands for Travail sur machine encadr√©s or in english: work in frame machines. 

In those classes we use MrPython as the IDE and Python as the language, and we try to solve problems and exercices with the helps of those tools.

You might notice through the code some especific ways of coding and comments and the reason for that is MrPython rules.
