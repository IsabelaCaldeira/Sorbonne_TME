 # TME classes in the first semestre: :blue_heart: 


In the first semestre, we used MrPython as the IDE and Python as the language, then we tried to solve some problems and exercices with the help of those tools.

You might notice through the code some especific ways of coding and comments and the reason for that is MrPython rules. 

There are two types of folders here, because we have some classes with themes and classes with as activites. Each one of them can be found in the exercice folders, so you have an idea of the exercice!

Also some of the code here is not the finish version because it wasn't used with the same IDE that I used to export to github. So if you find anything that can be update please send up a request for a merge! 

Have fun! <3
***The typying of variables in Python can also be done with others IDEs if you import the library Typing
