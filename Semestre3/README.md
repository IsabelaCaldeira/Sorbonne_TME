 # Third Semester :woman_technologist: :blue_heart: 

We have some interesting names on the folder as ISS and SDD, but what are they? And you want to spy further, that's what you should know! ðŸ‘€

SDD stands for Strucutres des DonnÃ©es (Data Structure) and as for ISS - is nothing as cool as something out of this world - but Initiation au SystÃ¨me et au Shell (Initiation to System and Shell)

I hope this gives you a better understanding on where to go next! :)
